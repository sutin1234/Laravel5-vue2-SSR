# Example implementations of our laravel-server-side rendering package

This repo contains examples of server-side rendered JavaScript SPAs rendered in a Laravel application using our home grown [spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering) package.

We've got a a `vue` + `vuex` + `vue-router` example and a very basic `react` + `react-router` example that will be expanded in the future.

## Installation

You can install the app locally like you'd install any other Laravel app.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering-examples.git
composer install
yarn
yarn production
```

If you want to see server side rendering in action, set your `.env` file's `APP_ENV` key to `production`.
